# CD-Yearly-Calculations

VB.NET Program that calculates an Initial Deposit ($) with a set yearly Interest Rate (%) that the user adds through user input textboxes on the UI.

The purpose of this program is to simulate CD interest calculations and show the growth of your initial deposit over the span of 1-10 years by compounding the interest rate to each year.

Three Buttons are placed within the VB.net form that does the calculations through code based on your initial deposit & interest rate.
There is also a combo box that lets the user change the currency type from different parts of the world. It then converts your deposit amount to the respective currency.

A Clear & Quit Button are also implemented. The clear button clears the form and erases the inputs. The Quit Button prompts the user if they truly want to quit, if they do, the form closes and program stops running.
